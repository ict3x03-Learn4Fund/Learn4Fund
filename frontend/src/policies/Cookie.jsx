            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. Cookies
            set by the website owner (in this case, Learn4Fund) are called "first
            party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner
            are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third
            party features or functionality to be provided on or through the

            it visits certain other websites.
